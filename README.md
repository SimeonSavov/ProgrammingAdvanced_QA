## About the First Section - String and Text Processing (Lesson 1)

In the first section of the "Programming Advanced for QA" course, I embarked on a journey into the world of string and text processing in C#. Here's a summary of what I've explored and achieved:

1.  **Reversing Words:** Task 1 introduced me to the concept of string manipulation by reversing words. I developed code that reads user input, reverses the characters in each word, and displays the reversed word pairs. This task emphasized string manipulation and the usage of `Reverse()` method.
    
2.  **Repeating Characters:** Task 2 challenged me to create a program that repeats characters within words, exploring the power of string manipulation. I constructed code that reads and splits user input, then repeats characters in each word and displays the resulting concatenated string.
    
3.  **Word Removal:** Task 3 honed my skills in text processing by enabling me to remove specific words from a given text. I developed code that searches and removes user-defined words from the text. This task emphasized text replacement and user input handling.
    
4.  **Censoring Words:** Task 4 introduced me to word censoring, an important text processing concept. I crafted code that reads banned words and a text, replacing occurrences of banned words with asterisks. This task emphasized string replacement and word censorship.
    
5.  **Text Categorization:** Task 5 expanded my text processing capabilities by categorizing characters in a given text into three groups: digits, letters, and other symbols. I efficiently categorized characters based on their types and displayed them separately. This task demonstrated my proficiency in character categorization and string manipulation to handle diverse character types within a given text.
    

Throughout this section, I've delved into various aspects of string and text processing, honing my skills in string manipulation, text replacement, and user input handling. These fundamental concepts form the building blocks of more advanced text processing techniques, setting the stage for further exploration in the course.
